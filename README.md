# Why did I make this?
Usually online downloaders are riddled with ads, and I wanted a tool that I could easily reuse without having to tediously re-implement or fine tune every time. It's also extremely fast and lightweight contrasted to the long download times browsers take.

# Nothing happens when I run the program / it errors with `Nonetype object has no attribute span`
Take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70060263/pytube-attributeerror-nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-span for the time being. I expect Pytube will update to fix this issue.

I do not condone piracy of any sort, nor is that the intended usage of this tool.
