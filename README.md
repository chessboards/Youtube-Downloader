# Why did I make this?
Usually online downloaders are riddled with ads, and I wanted a tool that I could easily reuse without having to tediously re-implement or fine tune every time. It's also extremely fast and lightweight contrasted to the long download times browsers take.

# Disclaimer
I do not condone piracy of any sort, nor is that the intended usage of this tool.
